Ambidextra Mouse Switcher for Gnome Shell
==========================================

This is a simple gnome shell extension that adds a button to the top panel to quickly switch between left-handed and right-handed mouse configurations.



Why?
----

Simply because I spend way too much time on the computer and have a bad posture. This allows me to not put too much strain on one shoulder for extended periods of time. N.B. I am not a doctor and this is definitely NOT the way to avoid RSI. I am just publishing this because code wants to be free.


Installation
------------

Copy `ambidextra@charith.otiose.me` to `$HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`. You may need to use `gnome-tweak-tool` to enable the extension. Hit `Alt+F2` followed by `r` to reload Gnome Shell and the extension should get loaded. 


Clicking the panel button (marked with either `R` or `L` depending on your current mouse configuration) will toggle between left-handed and right-handed modes.
